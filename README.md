## üìÇ Assignment List

### Q1. Count Even and Odd Numbers
- **Objective**: Use loops and conditional statements with lists  
- **Problem**: Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers and counts how many are even and how many are odd.  

### Q2. Check Membership in Set
- **Objective**: Learn basic set operations and conditional checking  
- **Problem**: Create a set of fruits. Ask the user to input a fruit name and check whether it exists in the set or not.  

### Q3. Tuple Unpacking
- **Objective**: Practice accessing tuple elements  
- **Problem**: Given a tuple of three integers, unpack them into separate variables and print their values.  

### Q4. Find the Maximum Element
- **Objective**: Use `for` loop and conditionals  
- **Problem**: Write a Python program to find the maximum number in a given list **without using `max()`**.  

### Q5. Student Gradebook (Dictionary Operations)
- **Objective**: Use dictionaries for storing and updating key-value pairs  
- **Problem**: Create a dictionary where keys are student names and values are their marks. Add 3 students, then update marks for one student and print the final dictionary.  

### Q6. Remove Duplicates from a List Using Set
- **Objective**: Use sets to eliminate duplicates  
- **Problem**: Write a program that removes duplicate elements from a list using set operations, then returns a list of unique items.  

### Q7. Sum of List Until Negative Number
- **Objective**: Use loops and `break` statements  
- **Problem**: Write a Python program to input numbers into a list. Stop taking input when a negative number is entered and print the sum of all positive numbers entered so far.  

### Q8. Character Frequency Counter
- **Objective**: Practice dictionary and loops  
- **Problem**: Write a Python program to count and display the frequency of each character in a given string using a dictionary.  

### Q9. Nested Conditional: Eligibility Checker
- **Objective**: Use nested `if-else` conditions and user input  
- **Problem**: Ask the user for their age and citizenship status. If the age is over 18 and citizenship is `'Yes'`, print `"Eligible to Vote"`. Else, print the appropriate reason for ineligibility.  

### Q10. Fibonacci Series using While Loop
- **Objective**: Use loops and logic-based iteration  
- **Problem**: Write a Python program using a while loop to generate and print the Fibonacci series up to `n` terms (where `n` is user input). Stop if the number exceeds `1000`.
